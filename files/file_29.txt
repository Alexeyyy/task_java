There
was
no
possibility
of
taking
a
walk
that
day
We
had
beenwandering
indeed
in
the
leafless
shrubbery
an
hour
in
the
morning
but
since
dinner
Mrs
Reed
when
there
was
no
company
dined
early
the
cold
winter
wind
had
brought
with
it
clouds
so
sombre
and
arain
so
penetrating
that
further
out
door
exercise
was
now
out
ofthe
question
I
was
glad
of
it
I
never
liked
long
walks
especially
on
chillyafternoons
dreadful
to
me
was
the
coming
home
in
the
raw
twilight
with
nipped
fingers
and
toes
and
a
heart
saddened
by
the
chidingsof
Bessie
the
nurse
and
humbled
by
the
consciousness
of
myphysical
inferiority
to
Eliza
John
and
Georgiana
Reed
The
said
Eliza
John
and
Georgiana
were
now
clustered
round
theirmama
in
the
drawing
room
she
lay
reclined
on
a
sofa
by
thefireside
and
with
her
darlings
about
her
for
the
time
neitherquarrelling
nor
crying
looked
perfectly
happy
Me
she
haddispensed
from
joining
the
group
saying
She
regretted
to
be
underthe
necessity
of
keeping
me
at
a
distance
but
that
until
she
heardfrom
Bessie
and
could
discover
by
her
own
observation
that
I
wasendeavouring
in
good
earnest
to
acquire
a
more
sociable
andchildlike
disposition
a
more
attractive
and
sprightly
manner
something
lighter
franker
more
natural
as
it
were
she
reallymust
exclude
me
from
privileges
intended
only
for
contented
happy
little
children
What
does
Bessie
say
I
have
done
I
asked
Jane
I
don
t
like
cavillers
or
questioners
besides
there
issomething
truly
forbidding
in
a
child
taking
up
her
elders
in
thatmanner
Be
seated
somewhere
and
until
you
can
speak
pleasantly
remain
silent
A
breakfast
room
adjoined
the
drawing
room
I
slipped
in
there
Itcontained
a
bookcase
I
soon
possessed
myself
of
a
volume
takingcare
that
it
should
be
one
stored
with
pictures
I
mounted
into
thewindow
seat
gathering
up
my
feet
I
sat
cross
legged
like
a
Turk
and
having
drawn
the
red
moreen
curtain
nearly
close
I
was
shrinedin
double
retirement
Folds
of
scarlet
drapery
shut
in
my
view
to
the
right
hand
to
theleft
were
the
clear
panes
of
glass
protecting
but
not
separatingme
from
the
drear
November
day
At
intervals
while
turning
overthe
leaves
of
my
book
I
studied
the
aspect
of
that
winterafternoon
Afar
it
offered
a
pale
blank
of
mist
and
cloud
near
ascene
of
wet
lawn
and
storm
beat
shrub
with
ceaseless
rain
sweepingaway
wildly
before
a
long
and
lamentable
blast
I
returned
to
my
book
Bewick
s
History
of
British
Birds
theletterpress
thereof
I
cared
little
for
generally
speaking
and
yetthere
were
certain
introductory
pages
that
child
as
I
was
I
couldnot
pass
quite
as
a
blank
They
were
those
which
treat
of
thehaunts
of
sea
fowl
of
the
solitary
rocks
and
promontories
by
themonly
inhabited
of
the
coast
of
Norway
studded
with
isles
from
itssouthern
extremity
the
Lindeness
or
Naze
to
the
North
Cape
Where
the
Northern
Ocean
in
vast
whirls
Boils
round
the
naked
melancholy
islesOf
farthest
Thule
and
the
Atlantic
surgePours
in
among
the
stormy
Hebrides
Nor
could
I
pass
unnoticed
the
suggestion
of
the
bleak
shores
ofLapland
Siberia
Spitzbergen
Nova
Zembla
Iceland
Greenland
with
the
vast
sweep
of
the
Arctic
Zone
and
those
forlorn
regions
ofdreary
space
that
reservoir
of
frost
and
snow
where
firm
fieldsof
ice
the
accumulation
of
centuries
of
winters
glazed
in
Alpineheights
above
heights
surround
the
pole
and
concentre
themultiplied
rigours
of
extreme
cold
Of
these
death
white
realms
Iformed
an
idea
of
my
own
shadowy
like
all
the
half
comprehendednotions
that
float
dim
through
children
s
brains
but
strangelyimpressive
The
words
in
these
introductory
pages
connectedthemselves
with
the
succeeding
vignettes
and
gave
significance
tothe
rock
standing
up
alone
in
a
sea
of
billow
and
spray
to
thebroken
boat
stranded
on
a
desolate
coast
to
the
cold
and
ghastlymoon
glancing
through
bars
of
cloud
at
a
wreck
just
sinking
I
cannot
tell
what
sentiment
haunted
the
quite
solitary
churchyard
with
its
inscribed
headstone
its
gate
its
two
trees
its
lowhorizon
girdled
by
a
broken
wall
and
its
newly
risen
crescent
attesting
the
hour
of
eventide
The
two
ships
becalmed
on
a
torpid
sea
I
believed
to
be
marinephantoms
The
fiend
pinning
down
the
thief
s
pack
behind
him
I
passed
overquickly
it
was
an
object
of
terror
So
was
the
black
horned
thing
seated
aloof
on
a
rock
surveying
adistant
crowd
surrounding
a
gallows
Each
picture
told
a
story
mysterious
often
to
my
undevelopedunderstanding
and
imperfect
feelings
yet
ever
profoundlyinteresting
as
interesting
as
the
tales
Bessie
sometimes
narratedon
winter
evenings
when
she
chanced
to
be
in
good
humour
and
when
having
brought
her
ironing
table
to
the
nursery
hearth
she
allowedus
to
sit
about
it
and
while
she
got
up
Mrs
Reed
s
lace
frills
and
crimped
her
nightcap
borders
fed
our
eager
attention
withpassages
of
love
and
adventure
taken
from
old
fairy
tales
and
otherballads
or
as
at
a
later
period
I
discovered
from
the
pages
ofPamela
and
Henry
Earl
of
Moreland
With

on
my
knee
I
was
then
happy

in

Boh
Madam
Mope
cried
the
voice
of
John

then
he
paused
he
found
the

apparently
empty

he
continued

I
drew

thought
I
and
I
wished
ferventlyhe
might
not
discover
my
hiding
place
nor
would
John
Reed
havefound
it
out
himself
he
was
not
quick
either
of
vision

but
Eliza
just
put
her
head
in
at
the
door
and
said
atonce
She
is

Jack
And
I
came
out
immediately
for
I
trembled
at
the
idea
of
beingdragged
forth
by
the

Jack

I
asked
with
awkward
diffidence
Say

Reed
was
the
answer
I
want

here
and
seating
himself
in
an

chair
he
intimated
bya
gesture
that
I
was
to
approach

stand
before
him
John
Reed
was
a
schoolboy
of
fourteen
years
old
four

olderthan
I
for
I
was
but
ten
large
and
stout
for
his
age
with
adingy
and
unwholesome
skin
thick
lineaments
in
a
spacious
visage
heavy
limbs
and
large
extremities
He
gorged
himself
habitually
attable
which
made
him
bilious
and
gave
him
a
dim
and
bleared
eyeand
flabby
cheeks
He
ought
now
to
have
been
at
school
but
hismama
had
taken
him
home
for
a
month
or
two
on
account
of
hisdelicate
health
Mr
Miles
the
master
affirmed
that
he
would
dovery
well
if
he
had
fewer
cakes
and
sweetmeats
sent
him
from
home
but
the
mother
s
heart
turned
from
an
opinion
so
harsh
and
inclinedrather
to
the
more
refined
idea
that
John
s
sallowness
was
owing
toover
application
and
perhaps
to
pining
after
home

thewindow
seat
gathering
up
my
feet
I
sat
cross
legged
like
a
Turk
and
having
drawn
the
red
moreen
curtain
nearly
close
I
was
shrinedin
double
retirement
Folds
of
scarlet
drapery
shut
in
my
view
to
the
right
hand
to
theleft
were
the
clear
panes
of
glass
protecting
but
not
separatingme
from
the
drear
November
day
At
intervals
while
turning
overthe
leaves
of
my
book
I
studied
the
aspect
of
that
winterafternoon
Afar
it
offered
a
pale
blank
of
mist
and
cloud
near
ascene
of
wet
lawn
and
storm
beat
shrub
with
ceaseless
rain
sweepingaway
wildly
before
a
long
and
lamentable
blast
I
returned
to
my
book
Bewick
s
History
of
British
Birds
theletterpress
thereof
I
cared
little
for
generally
speaking
and
yetthere
were
certain
introductory
pages
that
child
as
I
was
I
couldnot
pass
quite
as
a
blank
They
were
those
which
treat
of
thehaunts
of
sea
fowl
of
the
solitary
rocks
and
promontories
by
themonly
inhabited
of
the
coast
of
Norway
studded
with
isles
from
itssouthern
extremity
the
Lindeness
or
Naze
to
the
North
Cape
Where
the
Northern
Ocean
in
vast
whirls
Boils
round
the
naked
melancholy
islesOf
farthest
Thule
and
the
Atlantic
surgePours
in
among
the
stormy
Hebrides
Nor
could
I
pass
unnoticed
the
suggestion
of
the
bleak
shores
ofLapland
Siberia
Spitzbergen
Nova
Zembla
Iceland
Greenland
with
the
vast
sweep
of
the
Arctic
Zone
and
those
forlorn
regions
ofdreary
space
that
reservoir
of
frost
and
snow
where
firm
fieldsof
ice
the
accumulation
of
centuries
of
winters
glazed
in
Alpineheights
above
heights
surround
the
pole
and
concentre
themultiplied
rigours
of
extreme
cold
Of
these
death
white
realms
Iformed
an
idea
of
my
own
shadowy
like
all
the
half
comprehendednotions
that
float
dim
through
children
s
brains
but
strangelyimpressive
The
words
in
these
introductory
pages
connectedthemselves
with
the
succeeding
vignettes
and
gave
significance
tothe
rock
standing
up
alone
in
a
sea
of
billow
and
spray
to
thebroken
boat
stranded
on
a
desolate
coast
to
the
cold
and
ghastlymoon
glancing
through
bars
of
cloud
at
a
wreck
just
sinking
I
cannot
tell
what
sentiment
haunted
the
quite
solitary
churchyard
with
its
inscribed
headstone
its
gate
its
two
trees
its
lowhorizon
girdled
by
a
broken
wall
and
its
newly
risen
crescent
attesting
the
hour
of
eventide
The
two
ships
becalmed
on
a
torpid
sea
I
believed
to
be
marinephantoms
The
fiend
pinning
down
the
thief
s
pack
behind
him
I
passed
overquickly
it
was
an
object
of
terror
So
was
the
black
horned
thing
seated
aloof
on
a
rock
surveying
adistant
crowd
surrounding
a
gallows
Each
picture
told
a
story
mysterious
often
to
my
undevelopedunderstanding
and
imperfect
feelings
yet
ever
profoundlyinteresting
as
interesting
as
the
tales
Bessie
sometimes
narratedon
winter
evenings
when
she
chanced
to
be
in
good
humour
and
when
having
brought
her
ironing
table
to
the
nursery
hearth
she
allowedus
to
sit
about
it
and
while
she
got
up
Mrs
Reed
s
lace
frills
and
crimped
her
nightcap
borders
fed
our
eager
attention
withpassages
of
love
and
adventure
taken
from
old
fairy
tales
and
otherballads
or
as
at
a
later
period
I
discovered
from
the
pages
ofPamela
and
Henry
Earl
of
Moreland
With
Bewick
on
my
knee
I
was
then
happy
happy
at

in

Boh
Madam
Mope
cried
the
voice
of
John
Reed
then
he
paused
he
found
the
room
apparently
empty
Where
the

is
she
he
continued
Lizzy
Georgy
callingto
his

Joan
is
not
here
tell

she

It
is

I
drew

thought
I
and
I
wished
ferventlyhe
might
not
discover
my
hiding
place
nor
would
John
Reed
havefound
it
out
himself
he
was
not
quick
either
of
vision
orconception
but
Eliza
just
put
her
head
in
at
the
door
and
said
atonce
She
is
in
the
window
seat
to
be
sure
Jack
And
I
came
out
immediately
for
I
trembled
at
the
idea
of
beingdragged
forth
by
the
said
Jack
What
do
you
want
I
asked
with
awkward
diffidence
Say
What
do
you
want
Master
Reed
was
the
answer
I
want
youto
come
here
and
seating
himself
in
an
arm
chair
he
intimated
bya
gesture
that
I
was
to
approach
and
stand
before
him
John
Reed
was
a
schoolboy
of
fourteen
years
old
four
years
olderthan
I
for
I
was
but
ten
large
and
stout
for
his
age
with
adingy
and
unwholesome
skin
thick
lineaments
in
a
spacious
visage
heavy
limbs
and
large
extremities
He
gorged
himself
habitually
attable
which
made
him
bilious
and
gave
him
a
dim
and
bleared
eyeand
flabby
cheeks
He
ought
now
to
have
been
at
school
but
hismama
had
taken
him
home
for
a
month
or
two
on
account
of
hisdelicate
health
Mr
Miles
the
master
affirmed
that
he
would
dovery
well
if
he
had
fewer
cakes
and
sweetmeats
sent
him
from
home
but
the
mother
s
heart
turned
from
an
opinion
so
harsh
and
inclinedrather
to
the
more
refined
idea
that
John
s
sallowness
was
owing
toover
application
and
perhaps
to
pining
after
home
John
had
not
much
affection
for
his
mother
and
sisters
and
an
There
was
no
possibility
of
taking
a
walk
that
day
We
had
beenwandering
indeed
in
the
leafless
shrubbery
an
hour
in
the
morning
but
since
dinner
Mrs
Reed
when
there
was
no
company
dined
early
the
cold
winter
wind
had
brought
with
it
clouds
so
sombre
and
arain
so
penetrating
that
further
out
door
exercise
was
now
out
ofthe
question
I
was
glad
of
it
I
never
liked
long
walks
especially
on
chillyafternoons
dreadful
to
me
was
the
coming
home
in
the
raw
twilight
with
nipped
fingers
and
toes
and
a
heart
saddened
by
the
chidingsof
Bessie
the
nurse
and
humbled
by
the
consciousness
of
myphysical
inferiority
to
Eliza
John
and
Georgiana
Reed
The
said
Eliza
John
and
Georgiana
were
now
clustered
round
theirmama
in
the
drawing
room
she
lay
reclined
on
a
sofa
by
thefireside
and
with
her
darlings
about
her
for
the
time
neitherquarrelling
nor
crying
looked
perfectly
happy
Me
she
haddispensed
from
joining
the
group
saying
She
regretted
to
be
underthe
necessity
of
keeping
me
at
a
distance
but
that
until
she
heardfrom
Bessie
and
could
discover
by
her
own
observation
that
I
wasendeavouring
in
good
earnest
to
acquire
a
more
sociable
andchildlike
disposition
a
more
attractive
and
sprightly
manner
something
lighter
franker
more
natural
as
it
were
she
reallymust
exclude
me
from
privileges
intended
only
for
contented
happy
little
children
What
does
Bessie
say
I
have
done
I
asked
Jane
I
don
t
like
cavillers
or
questioners
besides
there
issomething
truly
forbidding
in
a
child
taking
up
her

in
thatmanner
Be
seated

silent
A

adjoined

slipped

myself

tothe

I

churchyard
with
its

its

its

its

was
the
black
horned
thing
seated
aloof
on

told

Madam

cried
the
voice
of

paused
he
found

apparently
empty

and

John

havefound

out
himself
he
was
not

either
of

Eliza
just
put
her
head
in
at

door
and
said
atonce

Jack
And
I
came
out
immediately
for
I
trembled
at
the
idea
of
beingdragged
forth
by
the
said
Jack
What
do
you
want
I
asked
with
awkward
diffidence
Say
What
do
you
want
Master
Reed
was
the
answer
I
want
youto
come
here
and
seating
himself
in
an
arm
chair
he
intimated
bya
gesture
that
I
was
to
approach
and
stand
before
him
John
Reed
was
a
schoolboy
of
fourteen
years
old
four
years
olderthan
I
for
I
was
but
ten
large
and
stout
for
his
age
with
adingy
and
unwholesome
skin
thick
lineaments
in
a
spacious
visage
heavy
limbs
and
large
extremities
He
gorged
himself
habitually
attable
which
made
him
bilious
and
gave
him
a
dim
and
bleared
eyeand
flabby
cheeks
He
ought
now
to
have
been
at
school
but
hismama
had
taken
him
home
for
a
month
or
two
on
account
of
hisdelicate
health
Mr
Miles
the
master
affirmed
that
he
would
dovery
well
if
he
had
fewer
cakes
and
sweetmeats
sent
him
from
home
but
the
mother
s
heart
turned
from
an
opinion
so
harsh
and
inclinedrather
to
the
more
refined
idea
that
John
s
sallowness
was
owing
toover
application
and
perhaps
to
pining
after
home
John
had
not
much
affection
for
his

and

There
was
no
possibility
of
taking
a
walk
that
day
We
had
beenwandering
indeed
in
the
leafless
shrubbery
an
hour
in
the
morning
but
since
dinner
Mrs
Reed
when
there
was
no
company
dined
early
the
cold
winter
wind
had
brought
with
it
clouds
so
sombre
and
arain
so
penetrating
that
further
out
door
exercise
was
now
out
ofthe
question
I
was
glad
of
it
I
never
liked
long
walks
especially
on
chillyafternoons
dreadful
to
me
was
the
coming
home
in
the
raw
twilight
with
nipped
fingers
and
toes
and
a
heart
saddened
by
the
chidingsof
Bessie
the
nurse
and
humbled
by
the
consciousness
of
myphysical
inferiority
to
Eliza
John
and
Georgiana
Reed
The
said
Eliza
John
and
Georgiana
were
now
clustered
round
theirmama
in
the
drawing
room
she
lay
reclined
on
a
sofa
by
thefireside
and
with
her
darlings
about
her
for
the
time
neitherquarrelling
nor
crying
looked
perfectly
happy
Me
she
haddispensed
from
joining
the
group
saying
She
regretted
to
be
underthe
necessity
of
keeping
me
at
a
distance
but
that
until
she
heardfrom
Bessie
and
could
discover
by
her
own
observation
that
I
wasendeavouring
in
good
earnest
to
acquire
a
more
sociable
andchildlike
disposition
a
more
attractive
and
sprightly
manner
something
lighter
franker
more
natural
as
it
were
she
reallymust
exclude
me
from
privileges
intended
only
for
contented
happy
little
children
What
does
Bessie
say
I
have
done
I
asked
Jane
I
don
t
like
cavillers
or
questioners
besides
there
issomething
truly
forbidding
in
a
child
taking
up
her

in
thatmanner
Be
seated
somewhere
and
until
you
can

pleasantly
remain
silent
A
breakfast
room
adjoined
the
drawing
room
I
slipped
in
there
Itcontained
a
bookcase
I
soon
possessed
myself
of
a
volume
takingcare
that
it
should
be
one
stored
with
pictures
I
mounted
into
thewindow
seat
gathering
up
my
feet
I
sat
cross
legged
like
a
Turk
and
having
drawn
the
red
moreen
curtain
nearly
close
I
was
shrinedin
double
retirement
Folds
of
scarlet
drapery
shut
in
my

were
the
clear

of
glass
protecting

not

from

November
day
At
intervals
while
turning
overthe
leaves
of
my
book
I
studied
the
aspect
of
that
winterafternoon
Afar
it
offered
a
pale
blank
of
mist
and
cloud
near
ascene
of
wet
lawn
and
storm
beat
shrub
with
ceaseless
rain
sweepingaway
wildly
before
a
long
and
lamentable
blast
I
returned
to
my
book
Bewick
s
History
of
British
Birds
theletterpress
thereof
I
cared
little
for
generally
speaking
and
yetthere
were
certain
introductory
pages
that
child
as
I
was
I
couldnot
pass
quite
as
a

They
were
those
which
treat
of

of

of

of

vast
whirls
Boils
round
the
naked
melancholy
islesOf
farthest
Thule
and
the
Atlantic
surgePours
in
among
the
stormy
Hebrides
Nor
could
I
pass
unnoticed
the
suggestion
of
the
bleak
shores
ofLapland
Siberia
Spitzbergen
Nova
Zembla
Iceland
Greenland
with
the
vast
sweep
of
the
Arctic
Zone
and
those

ofdreary

And
I

at

I
asked

Master

was
the
answer
I
want

seating
himself
in

he
intimated
bya

that

John
Reed
was
a
schoolboy
of
fourteen
years
old
four

I
for
I
was
but
ten
large
and
stout
for
his
age
with
adingy
and
unwholesome
skin
thick
lineaments
in
a
spacious
visage
heavy
limbs
and
large
extremities
He
gorged
himself
habitually
attable
which
made
him
bilious
and
gave
him
a
dim
and
bleared
eyeand
flabby
cheeks
He
ought
now
to
have
been
at
school
but
hismama
had
taken
him
home
for
a
month
or
two
on

the

affirmed
that

the

from
an
opinion
so
harsh
and
inclinedrather
to
the
more
refined
idea
that
John
s
sallowness
was
owing

application

There
was
no
possibility
of
taking
a
walk
that
day
We
had
beenwandering
indeed
in
the
leafless
shrubbery
an
hour
in
the
morning
but
since
dinner
Mrs
Reed
when
there
was
no
company
dined
early
the
cold
winter
wind
had
brought
with
it
clouds
so
sombre
and
arain
so
penetrating
that
further
out
door
exercise
was
now
out
ofthe
question
I
was
glad
of
it
I
never
liked
long
walks
especially
on
chillyafternoons
dreadful
to
me
was
the
coming
home
in
the
raw
twilight
with
nipped
fingers
and
toes
and
a
heart
saddened
by
the
chidingsof
Bessie
the
nurse
and
humbled
by
the
consciousness
of
myphysical
inferiority
to
Eliza
John
and
Georgiana
Reed
The
said
Eliza
John
and
Georgiana
were
now
clustered
round
theirmama
in
the
drawing
room
she
lay
reclined
on
a
sofa
by
thefireside
and
with
her
darlings
about
her
for
the
time
neitherquarrelling
nor
crying
looked
perfectly
happy
Me
she
haddispensed
from
joining
the
group
saying
She
regretted
to
be
underthe
necessity
of
keeping
me
at
a
distance
but
that
until
she
heardfrom
Bessie
and
could
discover
by
her
own
observation
that
I
wasendeavouring
in
good
earnest
to
acquire
a
more
sociable
andchildlike
disposition
a
more
attractive
and
sprightly
manner
something
lighter
franker
more
natural
as
it
were
she
reallymust
exclude
me
from
privileges
intended
only
for
contented
happy
little
children
What
does
Bessie
say
I
have
done
I
asked
Jane
I
don
t
like
cavillers
or

besides
there
issomething

Be
seated
somewhere
and
until
you
can
speak
pleasantly
remain
silent
A
breakfast
room
adjoined
the
drawing
room
I
slipped
in
there
Itcontained
a
bookcase
I
soon
possessed
myself
of
a
volume
takingcare
that
it
should
be
one
stored
with
pictures
I
mounted
into
thewindow
seat
gathering
up
my
feet
I
sat
cross
legged
like
a
Turk
and
having
drawn
the
red
moreen
curtain
nearly
close
I
was
shrinedin
double
retirement
Folds
of
scarlet
drapery
shut
in
my
view
to
the
right
hand
to
theleft
were
the
clear
panes
of
glass
protecting

not

from
the
drear
November
day
At
intervals
while
turning
overthe
leaves
of
my
book
I
studied
the
aspect
of
that
winterafternoon
Afar
it
offered
a
pale
blank
of
mist
and
cloud
near
ascene
of
wet
lawn
and
storm
beat
shrub
with
ceaseless
rain
sweepingaway
wildly
before
a
long
and
lamentable
blast
I
returned
to
my
book
Bewick
s
History
of
British
Birds
theletterpress
thereof
I
cared
little
for
generally
speaking
and
yetthere
were
certain
introductory
pages
that
child
as
I
was
I
couldnot
pass
quite
as
a
blank
They
were
those
which
treat
of
thehaunts
of
sea
fowl
of
the
solitary
rocks
and
promontories
by
themonly
inhabited
of
the
coast
of
Norway
studded
with
isles
from
itssouthern
extremity
the
Lindeness
or
Naze
to
the
North
Cape
Where
the
Northern
Ocean
in
vast
whirls
Boils
round
the
naked
melancholy
islesOf
farthest
Thule
and
the
Atlantic
surgePours
in
among
the
stormy
Hebrides
Nor
could
I
pass
unnoticed
the
suggestion
of
the
bleak
shores
ofLapland
Siberia
Spitzbergen
Nova
Zembla
Iceland
Greenland
with
the
vast
sweep
of
the
Arctic
Zone
and
those
forlorn
regions
ofdreary
space
that
reservoir
of
frost
and
snow
where
firm
fieldsof
ice
the
accumulation
of
centuries
of
winters
glazed
in
Alpineheights
above
heights
surround
the
pole
and
concentre
themultiplied
rigours
of
extreme
cold
Of
these
death
white
realms
Iformed
an
idea
of
my
own
shadowy
like
all
the
half
comprehendednotions
that
float
dim
through
children
s
brains
but
strangelyimpressive
The
words
in
these
introductory
pages
connectedthemselves
with
the
succeeding
vignettes
and
gave
significance
tothe
rock
standing
up
alone
in
a
sea
of
billow
and
spray
to
thebroken
boat
stranded
on
a
desolate
coast
to
the
cold
and
ghastlymoon
glancing
through
bars
of
cloud
at
a
wreck
just
sinking
I
cannot
tell
what
sentiment
haunted
the
quite
solitary
churchyard
with
its
inscribed
headstone
its
gate
its
two
trees
its
lowhorizon
girdled
by
a
broken
wall
and
its
newly
risen
crescent
attesting
the
hour
of
eventide
The
two
ships
becalmed
on
a
torpid
sea
I
believed
to
be
marinephantoms
The
fiend
pinning
down
the
thief
s
pack
behind
him
I
passed
overquickly
it
was
an
object
of
terror
So
was
the
black
horned
thing
seated
aloof
on
a
rock
surveying
adistant
crowd
surrounding
a
gallows
Each
picture
told
a
story
mysterious
often
to
my
undevelopedunderstanding
and
imperfect
feelings
yet
ever
profoundlyinteresting
as
interesting
as
the
tales
Bessie
sometimes
narratedon
winter
evenings
when

to
be
in
good
humour
and

sombre
and
arain
so
penetrating

door
exercise
was
now
out
ofthe
question
I
was
glad
of
it
I
never
liked
long
walks
especially
on
chillyafternoons
dreadful
to
me
was
the
coming
home
in
the
raw
twilight
with
nipped
fingers
and
toes
and
a
heart
saddened
by
the
chidingsof
Bessie
the
nurse
and
humbled
by
the
consciousness
of
myphysical
inferiority
to
Eliza
John
and
Georgiana
Reed
The
said
Eliza
John
and
Georgiana
were
now
clustered
round
theirmama
in
the
drawing
room
she
lay
reclined
on
a
sofa
by
thefireside
and
with
her
darlings
about
her
for
the
time
neitherquarrelling
nor
crying
looked
perfectly
happy

she

from

saying
She
regretted
to
be
underthe
necessity
of
keeping
me
at

but
that
until
she
heardfrom
Bessie
and
could
discover
by
her
own
observation
that
I
wasendeavouring
in
good
earnest
to
acquire
a
more
sociable
andchildlike
disposition
a
more
attractive

sprightly
manner
something
lighter
franker
more
natural
as
it
were
she
reallymust
exclude
me
from
privileges
intended
only
for
contented
happy
little
children
What
does
Bessie
say
I
have
done
I
asked
Jane
I

Be
seated
somewhere
and

pleasantly
remain
silent
A
breakfast
room
adjoined
the
drawing
room
I
slipped
in
there
Itcontained
a
bookcase
I
soon
possessed
myself
of
a
volume
takingcare
that
it
should
be
one
stored
with
pictures
I
mounted
into
thewindow
seat
gathering
up
my
feet
I
sat
cross
legged
like
a
Turk
and
having
drawn
the
red
moreen
curtain
nearly
close
I
was
shrinedin
double
retirement
Folds
of
scarlet
drapery
shut
in
my
view
to
the
right
hand
to

were
the
clear
panes
of
glass
protecting

not

from

drear
November
day
At
intervals
while
turning
overthe
leaves
of
my
book
I
studied
the
aspect
of
that
winterafternoon
Afar
it
offered
a
pale
blank
of
mist
and
cloud
near
ascene
of
wet
lawn
and
storm
beat
shrub
with
ceaseless
rain
sweepingaway
wildly
before
a
long
and
lamentable
blast
I
returned
to
my
book
Bewick
s
History
of
British
Birds
theletterpress
thereof
I
cared
little
for
generally
speaking
and
yetthere
were
certain
introductory
pages
that
child
as
I
was
I
couldnot
pass
quite
as
a
blank
They
were
those
which
treat
of
thehaunts
of
sea
fowl
of
the
solitary
rocks
and
promontories
by
themonly
inhabited
of
the
coast
of
Norway
studded
with
isles
from
itssouthern
extremity
the
Lindeness
or
Naze
to
the
North
Cape
Where
the
Northern
Ocean
in
vast
whirls
Boils
round
the
naked
melancholy
islesOf
farthest
Thule
and
the
Atlantic
surgePours
in
among
the
stormy
Hebrides
Nor
could
I
pass
unnoticed
the
suggestion
of
the
bleak
shores
ofLapland
Siberia
Spitzbergen
Nova
Zembla
Iceland
Greenland
with
the
vast
sweep
of
the
Arctic
Zone
and
those
forlorn
regions
ofdreary
space
that
reservoir
of
frost
and
snow
where
firm
fieldsof
ice
the
accumulation
of
centuries
of
winters
glazed
in
Alpineheights
above
heights
surround
the
pole
and
concentre
themultiplied
rigours
of
extreme
cold
Of
these
death
white
realms
Iformed
an
idea
of
my
own
shadowy
like
all
the
half
comprehendednotions
that
float
dim
through
children
s
brains
but
strangelyimpressive
The
words
in
these
introductory
pages
connectedthemselves
with
the
succeeding
vignettes
and
gave
significance
tothe
rock
standing
up
alone
in
a
sea
of
billow
and
spray
to
thebroken
boat
stranded
on
a
desolate
coast
to
the
cold
and
ghastlymoon
glancing
through
bars
of
cloud
at
a
wreck
just
sinking
I
cannot
tell
what
sentiment
haunted
the
quite
solitary
churchyard
with
its
inscribed
headstone
its
gate
its
two
trees
its
lowhorizon
girdled
by
a
broken
wall
and
its
newly
risen
crescent
attesting
the
hour
of
eventide
The
two
ships
becalmed
on
a
torpid
sea
I
believed
to
be
marinephantoms
The
fiend
pinning
down
the
thief
s
pack
behind
him
I
passed
overquickly
it
was
an
object
of
terror
So
was
the
black
horned
thing
seated
aloof
on
a
rock
surveying
adistant
crowd
surrounding
a
gallows
Each
picture
told
a
story
mysterious
often
to
my
undevelopedunderstanding
and
imperfect
feelings
yet
ever
profoundlyinteresting
as
interesting
as
the
tales
Bessie
sometimes
narratedon
winter
evenings
when
she
chanced
to
be
in
good
humour
and
when
having
brought
her
ironing
table
to
the
nursery
hearth
she
allowedus
to
sit
about
it
and
while
she
got
up

frills
and
crimped
her
nightcap
borders
fed
our
eager
attention
withpassages
of
love
and
adventure
taken
from
old
fairy
tales
and
otherballads
or
as
at
a
later
period
I
discovered
from
the
pages
ofPamela
and

Earl
of
Moreland
With

on

I
was

Madam

cried
the
voice
of

then

paused
he
found

empty

I
and

might

nor

John

havefound
it
out
himself
he
was
not

either
of

Eliza
just
put
her
head
in
at
the
door
and
said
atonce

And
I
came
out
immediately
for

trembled
at
the

I
asked
with

was
the
answer
I

and
seating
himself
in
an

he
intimated
bya
gesture
that
I
was
to
approach

before
him
John
Reed
was
a
schoolboy
of
fourteen
years
old
four

olderthan
I
for
I
was
but
ten
large
and
stout
for
his
age
with
adingy
and
unwholesome
skin
thick
lineaments
in
a
spacious
visage
heavy
limbs
and
large
extremities
He
gorged
himself
habitually
attable
which
made
him
bilious
and
gave
him
a
dim
and
bleared
eyeand
flabby
cheeks
He
ought
now
to
have
been
at
school
but
hismama
had
taken
him
home
for
a
month
or
two
on

of
hisdelicate
health
Mr
Miles
the
master
affirmed
that
he
would
dovery
well
if
he
had
fewer
cakes
and
sweetmeats
sent
him
from
home
but
the
mother
s
heart
turned
from
an
opinion
so
harsh
and
inclinedrather
to
the
more
refined
idea
that
John
s
sallowness
was
owing
toover
application
and
perhaps
to
pining
after
home

had
not

to

were
the
clear
panes
of
glass
protecting
but
not
separatingme
from
the
drear
November
day
At
intervals
while
turning
overthe
leaves
of
my
book
I
studied
the
aspect
of
that
winterafternoon
Afar
it
offered
a
pale
blank
of
mist
and
cloud
near
ascene
of
wet
lawn
and
storm
beat
shrub
with
ceaseless
rain
sweepingaway
wildly
before
a
long
and
lamentable
blast
I
returned
to
my
book
Bewick
s
History
of
British
Birds
theletterpress
thereof
I
cared
little
for
generally
speaking
and
yetthere
were
certain
introductory
pages
that
child
as
I
was
I
couldnot
pass
quite
as
a
blank
They
were
those
which
treat
of
thehaunts
of
sea
fowl
of
the
solitary
rocks
and
promontories
by
themonly
inhabited
of
the
coast
of
Norway
studded
with
isles
from
itssouthern
extremity
the
Lindeness
or
Naze
to
the
North
Cape
Where
the
Northern
Ocean
in
vast
whirls
Boils
round
the
naked
melancholy
islesOf
farthest
Thule
and
the
Atlantic
surgePours
in
among
the
stormy
Hebrides
Nor
could
I
pass
unnoticed
the
suggestion
of
the
bleak
shores
ofLapland
Siberia
Spitzbergen
Nova
Zembla
Iceland
Greenland
with
the
vast
sweep
of
the
Arctic
Zone
and
those
forlorn
regions
ofdreary
space
that
reservoir
of
frost
and
snow
where
firm
fieldsof
ice
the
accumulation
of
centuries
of
winters
glazed
in
Alpineheights
above
heights
surround
the
pole
and
concentre
themultiplied
rigours
of
extreme
cold
Of
these
death
white
realms
Iformed
an
idea
of
my
own
shadowy
like
all
the
half
comprehendednotions
that
float
dim
through
children
s
brains
but
strangelyimpressive
The
words
in
these
introductory
pages
connectedthemselves
with
the
succeeding
vignettes
and
gave
significance
tothe
rock
standing
up
alone
in
a
sea
of
billow
and
spray
to
thebroken
boat
stranded
on
a
desolate
coast
to
the
cold
and
ghastlymoon
glancing
through
bars
of
cloud
at
a
wreck
just
sinking
I
cannot
tell
what
sentiment
haunted
the
quite
solitary
churchyard
with
its
inscribed
headstone
its
gate
its
two
trees
its
lowhorizon
girdled
by
a
broken
wall
and
its
newly
risen
crescent
attesting
the
hour
of
eventide
The
two
ships
becalmed
on
a
torpid
sea
I
believed
to
be
marinephantoms
The
fiend
pinning
down
the
thief
s
pack
behind
him
I
passed
overquickly
it
was
an
object
of
terror
So
was
the
black
horned
thing
seated
aloof
on
a
rock
surveying
adistant
crowd
surrounding
a
gallows
Each
picture
told
a
story
mysterious
often
to
my
undevelopedunderstanding
and
imperfect
feelings
yet
ever
profoundlyinteresting
as
interesting
as
the
tales
Bessie
sometimes
narratedon
winter
evenings
when
she
chanced
to
be
in
good
humour
and
when
having
brought
her
ironing
table
to
the
nursery
hearth
she
allowedus
to
sit
about
it
and
while
she
got
up
Mrs
Reed
s
lace
frills
and
crimped
her
nightcap
borders
fed
our
eager
attention
withpassages
of
love
and
adventure
taken
from
old
fairy
tales
and
otherballads
or
as
at
a
later
period
I
discovered
from
the
pages
ofPamela
and
Henry
Earl
of
Moreland
With
Bewick
on
my
knee
I
was
then
happy
happy
at
least
in
my
way
breakfast
room
door
opened
Boh
Madam
Mope
cried
the
voice
of
John
Reed
then
he
paused
he
found
the
room
apparently
empty
Where
the
dickens
is
she
he
continued
Lizzy
Georgy
callingto
his
sisters
Joan
is
not
here
tell
mama
she
is
run
out
into

bad
animal
It
is
well
I
drew
the
curtain
thought
I
and
I
wished
ferventlyhe
might
not
discover
my
hiding
place
nor
would
John
Reed
havefound
it
out
himself
he
was
not
quick
either
of
vision
orconception
but
Eliza
just
put
her
head
in
at
the
door
and
said
atonce
She
is
in
the
window
seat
to
be
sure
Jack
And
I
came
out
immediately
for
I
trembled
at
the
idea
of
beingdragged
forth
by
the
said
Jack
What
do
you
want
I
asked
with
awkward
diffidence
Say
What
do
you
want
Master
Reed
was
the
answer
I
want
youto
come
here
and
seating
himself
in
an
arm
chair
he
intimated
bya
gesture
that
I
was
to
approach
and
stand
before
him
John
Reed
was
a
schoolboy
of
fourteen
years
old
four
years
olderthan
I
for
I
was
but
ten
large
and
stout
for
his
age
with
adingy
and
unwholesome
skin
thick
lineaments
in
a
spacious
visage
heavy
limbs
and
large
extremities
He
gorged
himself
habitually
attable
which
made
him
bilious
and
gave
him
a
dim
and
bleared
eyeand
flabby
cheeks
He
ought
now
to
have
been
at
school
but
hismama
had
taken
him
home
for
a
month
or
two
on
account
of
hisdelicate
health
Mr
Miles
the
master
affirmed
that
he
would
dovery
well
if
he
had
fewer
cakes
and
sweetmeats
sent
him
from
home
but
the
mother
successful
heart
turned
from
an
opinion
so
harsh
and
inclinedrather
to
the
more
refined
idea
that
John
swim
sallowness
was
owing
toover
application
and
perhaps
to
pining
after
home
John
had
not
much
affection
for
his
mother
and
sisters
and
